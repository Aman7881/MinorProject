          <h1>About the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</h1>
  
          <p>
            The test uses the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Originally created by Cohen et al (1983),
           it is a highly recognised psychological tool for measuring stress that's clinically validated and widely used.

          </p>
  
          <h2>How the PSS Quiz Works</h2>
          <p>
              The PSS quiz consists of a series of 10 questions that ask about your feelings and thoughts over the last month.
              For each question, you will be asked to choose from one of the following responses:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>0 = Never</li>
              <li>1 = Almost Never</li>
              <li>2 = Sometimes</li>
              <li>3 = Fairly Often</li>
              <li>4 = Very Often</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h2>Understanding Your Score</h2>
          <p>
              The total score is calculated by summing your responses to all 10 questions. Higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived stress.
          </p>
  
          <!-- Reverse Scoring Explanation -->
          <div class="reverse-scoring">
              <h3>Reverse Scoring for Positively Worded Questions</h3>
              <p>
                  Some questions in the PSS quiz are positively worded. For these questions, your responses are "reverse scored" to align with the stress evaluation.
                  This means that a response of "0" is scored as "4", a response of "1" is scored as "3", and so on.
                  This adjustment ensures that higher scores always reflect higher stress.
              </p>

          <h2>PSS Scoring Interpretation</h2>
          <p>
              Based on your total score, you will fall into one of the following categories:
